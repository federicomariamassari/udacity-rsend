# Elective 1: Autonomous Systems Interview Practice

- Path: __Perception/Sensor Engineer__

## Required Question

_Explain a recent project you've worked on. Why did you choose this project? What difficulties did you run into this project that you did not expect, and how did you solve them?_

As a requirements to graduate from Udacity's Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree, I recently deployed an autonomous robot that can fetch and deliver items in a Gazebo environment using ROS (Robot Operating System) and C++. The project combined SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), Navigation, and programming of custom ROS nodes, and was developed in Ubuntu Linux.

The project built on the experience gained from working on similar tasks, so overall it felt easier than the assignments I had completed earlier. Nevertheless, it still had its fair share of challenges.

The first one was designing a realistic environment for the robot to navigate. 


## Perception/Sensor Engineer Questions

### Question 1

_What are some of the advantages & disadvantages of cameras, lidar and radar? What combination of these (and other sensors) would you use to ensure appropriate and accurate perception of the environment?_

### Question 2

_How do features from algorithms like SIFT, SURF and HOG differ? Explain how these algorithms work, and how you would use them within a perception pipeline._

### Question 3

__[Code]__ _Describe how a particle filter works, where it is useful, and how it performs against similar algorithms. Code an example of how you update the weights of the particles between steps._
