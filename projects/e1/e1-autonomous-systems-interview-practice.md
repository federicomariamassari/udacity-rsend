# Elective 1: Autonomous Systems Interview Practice

- Path: __Perception/Sensor Engineer__

## Required Question

_Explain a recent project you've worked on. Why did you choose this project? What difficulties did you run into this project that you did not expect, and how did you solve them?_

As the capstone project of Udacity's Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree, I recently deployed an autonomous robot that could fetch and deliver items in a Gazebo environment using ROS and C++.

## Perception/Sensor Engineer Questions

### Question 1

_What are some of the advantages & disadvantages of cameras, lidar and radar? What combination of these (and other sensors) would you use to ensure appropriate and accurate perception of the environment?_

### Question 2

_How do features from algorithms like SIFT, SURF and HOG differ? Explain how these algorithms work, and how you would use them within a perception pipeline._

### Question 3

__[Code]__ _Describe how a particle filter works, where it is useful, and how it performs against similar algorithms. Code an example of how you update the weights of the particles between steps._
